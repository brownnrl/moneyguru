Currencies
==========

moneyGuru has strong support for multiple currencies. Every amount has a currency information. Any
amount you type can be in any currency. A lot of efforts have been made to make sure that you always
know what currency any amount is without hurting your eyes and putting explicit currency codes
everywhere.

One central concept in moneyGuru is that there are 2 types of currencies. The **native** currency
and the **foreign** currencies. The native currency is a per-document setting which can be changed
in the Document Properties view. It's the currency that is the most used in your document. The
foreign currencies are all other currencies.

The display of these currencies works with a very simple rule: If the amount is in your native
currency, it is shown plainly. If it's not, it is shown with the currency's 3 letter ISO code (USD,
CAD, EUR, GBP, etc..).

The rules for amount typing are just a little more complex: In almost all cases, typing a number
without any currency code means that this amount will be of your native's currency. However, if you
are on the Account view with an account that is not of your native's currency, typing an amount
without any currency code will create an amount with the **account**'s currency. The reason for this
is that even if your native currency is USD, when you are in a EUR account you **very** likely want
to type a EUR amount. Of course, in **all cases**, explicitly typing a currency code either in front
or after the number makes an amount of that currency.

Some other applications do automatic conversion of amount on transfer between accounts of different
currencies. That doesn't make much sense because if you withdraw 200 EUR in an ATM while on a trip,
the amount that will be removed from your USD account is pretty much **certain** not to be of the
exact exchange rate for that day. Anyway, exchange rate information are estimates and must be
treated as such. In moneyGuru, the currencies for an amount just stay as is (200 EUR) until you tell
it otherwise (you change the amount to USD after having received your bank statement).

Although moneyGuru doesn't use exchange rate to convert amounts in transactions, it does use them
for another purposes: net worth, profit and running balances estimates. Your net worth and profits
in moneyGuru are always displayed in your native currency. If you have an account of a foreign
currency, you can't have exact values anymore. When this happens, moneyGuru automatically fetches
the rates for each transaction's date and use those rates. For the running balance, it's possible
that you temporarily have an amount of a foreign currency in one of your asset or liability. Until
you reconcile this amount (and change it to the account's currency), the running balance that is
shown will be an estimate.

The sheets' exception
---------------------

There's a little exception to the implicitness of native currencies: sheets' totals. In the Net
Worth view and Profit & Loss view, totals (which are always displayed in the document's native
currency) will have their currency explicitly displayed when there's at least one account of a
different currency in the document.

This is to avoid a common confusion for new users who think that the totals don't add up. There's
also a rather common case where all accounts are in a currency that is different from the
document's currency because the document wasn't properly set up. Making the totals currency
explicit makes the problem obvious and thus easier to fix.

Multiple Currencies Transactions
--------------------------------

The vast majority of your transactions, even if you use multiple currencies, will only contain one
currency at once. If you buy a 200 EUR widget on Ebay with your USD credit card (which will create a
Credit Card --> Widgets transaction for 200 EUR), when you reconcile your Credit Card account, that
amount will be changed to USD (the credit card will charge you a USD amount for that 200 EUR).

However, if you make a transfer from an asset or liability to another asset or liability of a
different currency, the rules change. If for example you transfer 100 USD from your bank to a EUR
bank account you have, then one side of the transaction has to stay in USD, and the other side has
to stay in EUR.

This is a tricky problem. Because exchange rates are estimates, there is no way to balance that
transaction and, as you know, transaction must always balance. Therefore, an exception to the rule:
**A transaction involving more than one currency always balances**. In the example above, we will
end up with a transaction that credits 100 USD from one side and debits 65 EUR on the other side.

To create a multiple currencies transaction, just go to the "other side" of the transaction and type
the amount in that other currency. You can also use the transaction panel to manually edit the
entries. For example, to add that transaction described above, you would first go to Checking, add a
transaction for 100 USD and a transfer to "EUR Account". Then you go to "EUR Account" and change the
100 USD amount to 65 EUR. moneyGuru will automatically detect that the "other side" is an asset of a
different currency and that the 100 USD on that other side must be preserved thus, creating a
multiple currencies transaction.

Even if exchange rates are always estimates, banks and credit card companies have this tendency of
always giving you a lower-than-the-current exchange rate for your transactions involving more than
one currency. Therefore, even if multiple currencies transactions always balance, you sometimes want
to use the exchange rate to be able to balance the transaction so that you can count this difference
between the current exchange rate and the rate given to you by the bank as an expense. This is what
the **Multi-Currency Balance** button in the Transaction Info panel is for. When you click on it, a
new entry will be created in the transaction with the difference between the "two sides" of the
transaction when using the exchange rates for the transaction's date.

Currency Rules
--------------

* Amounts of foreign currencies are **always** explicitly displayed with their ISO code.
* Explicitly typing the ISO code of a currency for an amount **always** makes this amount an amount
  of the specified currency.
* Typing a plain amount always results in a native amount, except when:

    * editing an account of a foreign currency.
    * editing splits of a foreign transaction.

* Net worth and profits are calculated in the native currency.
* A transaction involving more than one currency always balances.

Custom Currencies
-----------------

Since v2.7.0, moneyGuru supports custom currencies through :doc:`plugins <plugins>`. You can define
new currencies and implement a custom exchange rate fetcher. If you want to do that, you should
start by looking at the bundled ``yahoo_currency_provider`` example plugin.
