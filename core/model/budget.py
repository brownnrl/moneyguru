    A budget provides a way to define a new budget.  It holds the intent to start budgeting from
    a start date, the budget cycle time span (before the difference carry report resets),
     and how many periods that this cycle should be split.

    The default will be 1 year budget cycles with 12 monthly budget periods.

    This structure is responsible for generating `.Budget` and modifying objects in the
    `.BudgetList` whenever these settings change.  For example, if a user changes the start date
    for their budget or the number of budget periods, any effects will be moderated through the

    A budgets yields spawns with amounts depending on how much money we've already spent in our

    for a month that has 25$ worth of clothing in it is going to be 75$. This only works in the
    future.

    Budgets work very similarly to recurrences, except that a twist must be applied to them so they
    can work properly. The twist is about the spawn's "recurrence" date and the effective date. The
    recurrence date must be at the beginning of the period, but the effective date must be at the end
    of it. The reason for it is that since recurrence are only cooked until a certain date (usually
    the current date range's end), but that the budget is affects the date range *prior* to it, the
    last budget of the date range will never be represented.

    All initialization variables are directly assigned to their corresponding attributes.
